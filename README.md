# CMS Hospital RatingÂ¶


	Fun fact: The probability of picking a 5-star rating hospital in the USA that is from Texas is 0.35%.
	
	Fun fact: The probability of picking a 1-star rating hospital in the USA that is from New York is 1.1%.

# Project Implications 
It is every hospital's dream to have a 5-star rating as it signifies the level of patient-care quality provided. The rating is one of many ways to showcase quality recognition and reputation. The dataset by Centers of Medicare and Medicaid, was downloaded on Kaggle dataset. This data can help us compare the quality of care among hospitals in the USA. This is an interesting project as the data can be used for predictive modeling using Python. The result of the machine learning algorithms can have implications:


	Hospitals - better resource-allocation strategy.
	Insurance - improve overall policies/practices and network coverage strategy.
	Patients - better understanding of their healthcare facilities and makes informed decision.



### Machine Learning: K-nearest neighbors, Support Vector Machines, and Random Forest as Predictive Models 
The objective of this project is to predict the hospital's rating, thus, the target variable or the y-variable is "Hospital overall rating". The project included comprehensive exploratory data analysis, data cleansing, and data visualization. Multiclass predictive models using machine learning from sci-kit learn libraries included K-nearest neighbor, Support Vector Machines, and Random Forest. The end result included the comparison of these models' performance.
